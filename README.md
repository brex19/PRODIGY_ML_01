# House Price Prediction with Linear Regression

## Overview

This repository contains code to implement a linear regression model for predicting the price of a house based on features such as square footage, the number of bathrooms, and the number of bedrooms. The model aims to provide accurate estimations of house prices, assisting homebuyers, sellers, and real estate professionals in making informed decisions.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis comprises historical data of house sales, including features such as:

- Square footage
- Number of bathrooms
- Number of bedrooms
- Sale price

The dataset may also include additional features such as location, amenities, and property type.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- NumPy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/brex19/PRODIGY_ML_01
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Prepare the dataset: Ensure that your dataset is in a suitable format for analysis, with relevant features such as square footage, the number of bathrooms, the number of bedrooms, and sale prices.

2. Run the `linear_regression.py` script:

    ```
    python linear_regression.py
    ```

3. Model evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the linear regression model using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared value.

4. Predict house prices: Use the trained model to predict house prices for new or unseen data, providing valuable insights for real estate transactions.

## Results

The linear regression model accurately predicts house prices based on square footage, the number of bathrooms, and the number of bedrooms, with high precision and reliability. The model's performance metrics demonstrate its effectiveness in capturing the underlying relationships between house features and sale prices, empowering stakeholders with actionable insights for decision-making.
